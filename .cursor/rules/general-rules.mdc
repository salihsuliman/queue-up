When adding new functions always make sure to add comments and jsdocs explain the function so anyone can understand what is happening.

Always make sure variable names are clear and clearly reflect the data their are assigned to.

When refactoring code always make sure you are not brekaing anything, especially anyhting that might be using the logic you refactored.

Never update file that are completely unrelated to the task you are doing.

Always make sure you are using the latest docs for the frameworks, libaries or tools you are using.
